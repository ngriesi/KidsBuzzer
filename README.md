App to handle serial input from buzzers build with arduino

I build buzzers with arduinos and nrf24l01+. They send their wireless signal to another arduino that is connected to the pc and sends the signal from the buzzers to the pc using
a serial port. This programm has diffrent sub programs for the buzzers to be able to do diffrent things.

Sub programs:
  - Make a buzzerpress equal to a key press
  - Make a buzzerpress equal to a mouse click
  - have a score board overlay where the buzzers are used to increase the score of the teams
  - have a "Quiztime" program where the app handles the presenation for a quiz show using the buzzers
